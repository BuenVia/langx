Change app idea:

LearnX: Instead of focusing on pre-defined language learning, allow the user to create notes and tests on their chosen subject.

The idea would be that a user can take notes, perform their own flash-style exercises on the subject and take a test that tracks scores.

The format will be "Learn, Practice, Test".

The hierachy would be:

    Subject
        |
    Category
|       |       |
Notes  Flash  Test
